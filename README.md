## Description
If you have an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME">SDR Dongle</a> that can receive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_Radio">NRSC-5</a> digital radio stations, you can use `yellowShoes` as the playback and control UI (User-interface). Navigate to your `yellowShoes` instance from a decent web browser, and you're good to go!


# Requirements
* You must have <a href="https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5">nrsc5</a> compiled and installed. The `nrsc5` binary must be in your `PATH`. 
* Optional Requirement: If you want mp3 playback (or have IOS devices), you will need `lame` encoder binary in your `PATH`. See [IOS Playback](./IOS/README.md) section.

# New Features

This feature can be enabled from Settings. 



## Album Art
<img src="./Screenshots/Screenshot%20at%202022-08-16%2021-27-37.png">

Album art has been enabled as an experimental [feature](https://github.com/evuraan/yellowShoes/issues/7). Album Art tiles works on mobile device lock screens and desktop browsers. 

Enabling this option will make your backend initiate network traffic to search and find cover/album art images. The results we find may be inaccurate or even inappropriate.

Builds that support Album Art are [ kept here](https://github.com/evuraan/yellowShoes/tree/yellowShoes_with_Webamp_Milkdrop/bin).


### Enabling Album Art
You must launch `yellowShoes` with `-enableAlbumArt` to enable album art. 
```bash
$ ./yellowShoes -enableAlbumArt
```
Then navigate to `Settings -> Cover Art` and [enable](./Screenshots/YellowShoes_EnableAlbumArt.png).

# Setup 
* Setup <a href="https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5">nrsc5</a>  
* Download the `yellowShoes` binary suitable for your Operating System and Platform from [bin folder](https://github.com/evuraan/yellowShoes/tree/yellowShoes_with_Webamp_Milkdrop/bin) of the [yellowShoes_with_Webamp_Milkdrop branch](https://github.com/evuraan/yellowShoes/tree/yellowShoes_with_Webamp_Milkdrop/bin). 

* Launch the  binary you downloaded:
```bash
$ ./yellowShoes -enableAlbumArt 
yellowShoes Ver 4.0a Copyright (C) Evuraan <evuraan@gmail.com>
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
Using temp dir: /tmp, port: 8113
```
Windows 
```powershell
PS C:\temp\yellowShoes\bin> .\yellowShoes-win-amd64.exe
```

* Launch a browser and navigate to `http://<Your_Address>:Port/main` to launch the UI. Example: `http://192.168.1.134:8113/main`


# Usage

Default port is 8113. If you wish to specify an alternate port or temp directory, use the appropriate input arguments:
```bash
$ ./yellowShoes -h
yellowShoes Ver 4.0a Copyright (C) Evuraan <evuraan@gmail.com>
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
Usage of ./yellowShoes:
  -enableAlbumArt
    	enable album art
  -port string
    	port to use (default "8113")
  -tempFolder string
    	temp folder with write access to use (default "/tmp")
  -v	print version information and exit
```


# Settings 
## Optional: rtl_tcp
If you have `rtl_tcp` running in your network,  yellowShoes can connect to it - navigate to the <a href='./Screenshots/Settings.png'>settings</a> section to set it up. 


# yellowShoes and Docker
You can run yellowShoes inside a Docker container. See the [Docker section](./Docker). 
# Routing/Proxying
Below example is how I pegged `yellowShoes` behind Apache: 
```bash
<Location /hdFm/>
ProxyPass  http://192.168.1.14:8113/
ProxyPassReverse http://192.168.1.14:8113/
Order deny,allow
Allow from all
Options -Indexes
</Location>
```
This would allow `proto://myapp.dev/hdFm/main` externally.
